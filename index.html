    <h2>A Linked Open Dataset with the focus on Anime</h2>
    <p>
      <span id="title" property="name">Between Our Worlds</span> is an initiative to provide metadata information about anime as Linked Open Data.
      <span class="speach">Wait, what is this Linked Data thingy you speak of?</span>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a>
      is a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and
      become more useful through <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_query">semantic queries</a>.
      This is something you can't do if you would , for example, store your data in a relational database.
      Furthermore, the word 'open' refers to the fact that the data is available under a free license.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core contribution of our initiative is a Linked Open Dataset.
      It is currently available by downloading the RDF <a href="{{site.url}}/data#datadump">datadump</a> or by quering our Triple Pattern Fragments <a href="{{site.url}}/data#tpf">server</a>.

      <li>provide <span class="bold">globally unique identifiers</span> for anime,</li>
      <li>use <span class="bold">globally unique, umambiguous property names</span>,</li>
      <li>provide a <span class="bold">self-describing dataset</span> for anime metadata,</li>
      <li>improve the <span class="bold">discoverability</span> of anime-related data, and</li>

  <div class="text" id="whatnot">
    <h2>The dataset has not as goal to</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold"> replace social and community platforms</span>,
        such as
        <a target="_blank" href="https://kitsu.io">Kitsu</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://myanimelist.net/">MyAnimeList</a>, and
        <a target="_blank" href="https://anidb.net">AniDB</a>.
        The dataset allows to talk about a uniquely identifiable anime, regardless of the platform.
        However, if the aforementioned platforms would incorporate the Linked Data principles,
        all of them would at any point know unambigously about which anime they are talking,
        without the need to rely on record-matching between platforms to find the same anime.
      </li>
      <li><span class="bold">be the central hub, datastore, or database for all anime-related data</span>.
        The initiative is concerned with the general metadata information about anime.
        User and application-specific data can and should be hosted by the user and/or the used application.
        This data can in turn link to our data, using the Linked Data <a traget="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">principles</a>.
