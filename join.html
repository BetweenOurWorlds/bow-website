      <span id="title">Between our Worlds</span> is an initiative created to support the publication of anime metadata as Linked Open Data.
      Therefore, we are open to suggestions, remarks, and contributions, whether you are a developer or not.
      You can find our code on <a href="https://github.com/BetweenOurWorlds">GitHub</a> and we hang out on <a href="https://gitter.im/BetweenOurWorlds/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link">Gitter</a> for a virtual coffee and a chat.
      It's also possible to <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/piehey">buy us a real cup of coffee</a>.
      This will help us to keep our caffeine levels high when we are working on the server.
